<dt>Was Shakespeare ever in love?
</dt><dd>
                        Yes, at age 18, Shakespeare married Anne Hathaway,
                          a woman 8 years his senior. They stayed married the
                          rest of Shakespeare&#146;s life for some 34 years until
                          Shakespeare died in 1616, age 52.</dd></dl>
                        <P><B>Is it true nobody knows Shakespeare&#146;s birthday?
                          </B></P>
                        <P><I>It is true we don&#146;t know Shakespeare&#146;s
                          date of birth. We know it was in 1564 but our only record
                          at this time was of his baptism at the Holy Trinity
                          Church on April the 26th. By convention and some guesswork,
                          Shakespeare&#146;s birthday is by tradition celebrated
                          three days earlier on April the 23rd.</I></P>
                        <P><B>At what age did Shakespeare write his first play?</B></P>
                        <P><I>It is believed that Shakespeare penned his first
                          play Henry VI, Part One, between 1589 and 1590. Shakespeare
                          would have been 25 at the time. This play is believed
                          to have been performed at The Rose Theatre in London.</I></P>
                        <P><B>Which are Shakespeare&#146;s most popular plays?</B></P>
                        <P><I>With 37 plays under his belt, it is hard to place
                          some plays above others. Nonetheless, most academics
                          and readers alike would agree that Hamlet, Romeo and
                          Juliet, The Merchant of Venice, A Midsummer&#146;s Night&#146;s
                          Dream, King Henry V, King Lear, Macbeth , Othello and
                          Antony and Cleopatra are amongst Shakespeare&#146;s
                          most recognizable and hence most popular plays.</I></P>
                        <P><B>Was Shakespeare a victim of "breech of copyright"?</B></P>
                        <P><I>In 1609, Shakespeare&#146;s sonnets were published
                          without the Bard&#146;s permission. Many academics considered
                          it unlikely that Shakespeare wanted many of his deeply
                          personal poems to be revealed to the outside world.
                          It was not however the first time; in 1599, in a collection
                          entitled "The Passionate Pilgrim", two of Shakespeare&#146;s
                          poems had been printed without the Bard&#146;s permission.</I></P>
                        <P><B>What Plays did Shakespeare write?</B></P>
                        <P><I>The list is extensive. In the best chronological
                          order available, Shakespeare wrote</i><B> </b><I>Henry

                        <P><B>Are any of Shakespeare&#146;s poems especially famous?
                          </B></P>
                        <P>Perhaps one poem is more famous than the other 154
                          sonnets for the shear number of times, popular movies
                          (Clueless for example), books, TV programs (The Darling
                          Buds of May) and reviews have used it&#146;s lines.
                        </P>
                        <P>Sonnet 18 begins with the opening lines, <I>" Shall
                          I compare thee</I> (you) <I>to a summer&#146;s day?
                          Thou </I>(you)<I> art </I>(are)<I> more lovely and more
                          temperate: Rough winds do shake the darling buds of
                          May, And Summer&#146;s lease hath all too short a date..."</i></P>
                        <P><B>Did Shakespeare "lose" a play?</B></P>
                        <P><I>Yes. He did not literally lose it in a park or on
                          his travels. The play Cardenio, though written and performed
                          in Shakespeare&#146;s time has not been recorded in
                          the First Folio of 1623 as were Shakespeare&#146;s other
                          plays. Cardenio has been lost to time for the modern
                          reader.</I></P>
